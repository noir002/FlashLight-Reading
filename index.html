      <h4>Now story time</h4>
      <p>
        There was once a small seed buried deep under the soil. It could not see the sky. It could not feel the sun. 
        All it knew was darkness and pressure from the earth above it. Every day felt heavy, and growth felt impossible.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        But something inside the seed kept pushing. It did not complain about the darkness. It did not wait for perfect conditions. 
        Slowly, quietly, it began to grow upward. The soil resisted. Rocks blocked the way. Still, it kept moving.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Days passed. Then one morning, the seed broke through the surface. For the first time, it saw the light. 
        The same soil that once buried it had actually protected it. The pressure that felt unbearable had made it stronger.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Growth often feels uncomfortable. Progress often feels invisible. But just because no one sees the struggle 
        does not mean it is not happening. Keep pushing. One day, you will break through your own surface and finally see the light.
